LaTowerRun
===============
General
===============

Implementation of 2 different games on the LaFortuna + demo mode
Interaction is done only via the 4 directions on the encoder.

===============
Games
===============

Tower:
The first game lets the user jump from platform to platform in attempt to reach as high as possible without falling from down.
The screen of the game is moving with an increasing speed (not moving the first few platforms), which forces the player to react faster and faster.

This game has 10 levels.

Run:
The second game is very similar to the first but instead of moving vertically the player has to run while trying to avoid walls comming his way. The left side of the screen acts as a wall the user can touch but it is moving forward and forcing the user to keep running.

This game has 5 levels.

===============
Demo
===============

When at the title screen if there is no interaction for 10 seconds the Demo mode is started.
In the Demo mode there is a bot playing the Tower game. This mode can be used as demonstration in order to show users how to play.

===============
Characters
===============

The user is given the opportunity to choose a character with which they can play. 
They are implemented via two sprites for each character (imitate movement).

===============
Known issues, which I did not have enough times to fix
===============

- from time to time in the Run game the user might not be able to move horizontally => restart the microcontroller
- sprites are held in RAM instead of PROGMEM

===============
Included code
===============

- Peter Danneger's code (adapted by Klaus-Peter Zauner) for the rotary encoder
- Steve Gunn's code (adapted by Klaus-Peter Zauner) for the lcd
- Giacomo Meanti's code for creating random integers (from his Space Invaders game)
